# Umbraco 7 Application Pool Refresh Plugin

Very simple plugin to refresh the Application Pool for the site from a developer section dashboard. This plugin just creates an AppSetting key that stores a date. When the refresh button is clicked the AppSetting key value is updated with the current date and time. So it is just simpley touching the web.config to trigger the refresh. Easy peasy lemon squeezy! 


Install

Download package (https://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/app-pool-refresh/) and install via the Umbraco back office, done.
